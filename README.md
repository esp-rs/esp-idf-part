A library for parsing and generating ESP-IDF partition tables. Supports parsing from and generating to both CSV and binary formats.

This package started its life as a module in [espflash](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/), however it has undergone some fairly extensive changes since being extracted into its own crate. A big thanks to all who contributed to that module, as their work helped make this library possible.

This library is reasonably well tested, however if you have a partition table which is not handled correctly by this library then please open an issue.

## Features

This library has only one feature, `std`, which is enabled by default. While this library _does_ support `no_std`, (de)serialization functionality is not supported without `std`.
